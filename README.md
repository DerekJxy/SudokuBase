# What is SudokuBase?
SudokuBase is an online platform for playing sudoku. The latest version is available here: www.sudokubase.com

# How does Sudokubase work?
The SudokuBase backend is based on the Spring Framework. Further technologies used for this project are 
MySQL, jQuery and of course the holy trinity: HTML, CSS and JS. SudokuBase uses a Sudoku engine called 
SudoGen, which is still a private project but will soon be available as open source. Deployment is done
on Heroku.

# What is the goal?
The goal is to create a free platform for sudoku-fans, providing unlimited puzzles for different levels
and additional features like a knowledge base, various training methods, competitive play, chat and various 
gamification features like rating, archievements and badges.
